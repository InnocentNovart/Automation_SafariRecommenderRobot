# Automation_SafariRecommenderRobot
#### About the project:
In this RPA project, I developed a robot that autonomously recommends the best safari destinations for you depending on your budget and other preferences such as number of days on tour and so on. It implements these functions using Uipath tools including data scrapper, python scope, and email automation. To achieve this, the robot carries the following steps: -
1. Web scrapping using Uipath data scrapper and saving the data into csv file
2. Recommending the famous safari destination using Uipath python scope
3. Recommending safari offers using Uipath python scope
4. Recommending the best months to go on a safari using Uipath python scope
5. Compiling the results from steps 2 to 4 into a single pdf report
6. Sends email to the user using Uipath email automation
